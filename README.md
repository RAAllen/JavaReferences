### A presentation and demonstration on Java reference variables and objects.

#### By _**Rebecca Allen**_

## Setup/Installation requirements

* In order to utilize this project you will need a terminal application such as Terminal or Bash, and a text editor application such as Atom or Eclipse.
* Start by opening the terminal application and typing the command "git clone https://github.com/RAAllen/JavaReferences.git" after navigating with the "cd" command to the location you would like the project to be cloned into.
* Use the terminal application to navigate to the project directory you just cloned down off of GitHub using the "cd" command.
* In order to run this program, type "java JavaReferences" while in the project directory.
* If that does not work, check to make sure a compiled version of the project is in the directory by typing "ls". You should see a JavaReferences.class file.
* If no JavaReferences.class file exists, create one by compiling the program with the command "javac JavaReferences.java". Then try running it again.
* To edit this program, after navigating into the project directory type the following commands: "atom .". If you are using Atom. This should open the project in your editor.
* If you are using Eclipse, type "open /Applications/eclipse.app" in your terminal. This will open the Eclipse editor. You must then open the specific project from within the Eclipse file interface. Depending on your version and display options this is done by going to the "File" tab at the top of the application. After clicking "File" a drop down menu should appear, select "Open Projects From File System" from the drop down menu, then select the location you cloned the project as the file to open. Leave "Search for nested projects" and "Detect and configure project natures" selected, select whichever working set you would like the project to be in located in. Select "Finish" at the bottom right hand corner and the project should be imported in.

## Program Specifications

* The program will illustrate the interaction between references and objects, with comments on what is happening and why.
* The program will step by step break down for a user when a reference is no longer pointing to an object, indicating it is ready for garbage collection.
* The program will demonstrate the difference between comparing object identity comparisons using the "==" operator to compare whether two references are both pointing to the same object and using the .equals() method to compare the contents of an object for equality.
* The program will demonstrate the difference of passing by value and passing by reference.
